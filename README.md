# ConfigLib [Legacy Fork]

**A Minecraft library for saving, loading, updating, and commenting YAML
configuration files.**

## Fork Notice
This fork of the library ports the project back Java 11,
so it can be used in legacy versions/projects that do not use the latest version of Java and wish to use this library.

The way this is achieved is by porting the Java Version, and syntax used in the project back to Java 11's standards.
Also, the major differences is the removal of records.
This is because Records were introduced in Java 17 and are not available in Java 11 (duh).

I do not care to revamp the readme to be in-line with the changes,
so if you're looking to learn how to use this library, read the original README.md in the parent repository.
